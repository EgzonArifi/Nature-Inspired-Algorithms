Ants are agents that:

• Move along between nodes in a graph.

• They choose where to go based on pheromone strength (and
maybe other information)

• An ant’s path represents a specific candidate solution.

• When an ant has finished a solution, pheromone is laid on
its path, according to quality of solution.

• This pheromone trail affects behaviour of other ants by `stigmergy`
